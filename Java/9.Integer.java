// THis is about Integer, integers are used as variables especially whern it is numbers involved 

class ExampleInt {
public static void main(String[] args) {
    int num1 = 1;   
    int num2 = 1;
    int result = num1 * num2; 
    System.out.println(num1+" x "+num2+" = "+result+"\n");
}// THis last line prints whatever the int represents while the ones in quotes are printed to show the operatrs and results
}

//Basically this code prints out basic multiplication
