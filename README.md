Want to test if git will be adding in my commits currently it doesnt seem so 

Not sure why so I have already 

1. starred my repos that I am using 
2. Also have been trying to add in my email which I may have a lead.


New plan of action I will begin to start commenting on my own work and also adding the link of where I had done the work and gotten the code and also update this
